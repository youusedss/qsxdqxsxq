<h2>Brawl Stars, What is it about?</h2>
<p>Brawl Stars is one of the most successful games in 2017/2018. Brawl Stars, where you can play alone, in pairs or as a team of up to 4 people against up to 99 other players. It is based on the Brawl Stars genre where the last survivor wins on the map. The online game now has over 125 million registered users worldwide.</p>
<p>Brawl Stars is free and there is a long-lasting, big hype about brawl stars, especially among teenagers who play the game almost every day. It&#8217;s great that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell_(video_game_company)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supercell</a> offers Brawl Stars for free, as anyone who wants to play Brawl Stars can play alone or with all his friends. Brawl Stars earns popularity through its funny comic look, which is underlined by humorous emotes.</p>
<h3>Mode 1: Battle Royal</h3>
<p>The Brawl Stars mode takes place in third-person and is a shooter. At the beginning of the battles you find yourself in the so-called &#8220;Battle Bus&#8221;, a bus that is transported by a hot air balloon through the air. The players jump out of the Battle Bus, open their parachutes and land on the huge playing card.</p>

<p>There they must try to get inside of cities and villages outside and inside the houses to various items such as weapons, equipment and raw materials. Pickaxe can be used to break down building materials such as wood, stone and metal so that almost everything in the world can be destroyed. You can also build objects such as walls, stairs and walls by installing previously collected materials. These walls then serve as cover and can be strategically placed well.</p>
<p>You can also try to play your opponent as strategically as possible. The goal is to kill his opponents with weapons or traps. Protective walls can be destroyed by enough damage. You have to pay attention to the border, which moves closer and closer to the center of the map after certain periods of time. If you spend too much time outside the border, you die. This should cause all players to meet in the middle of the map sooner or later.</p>

<h2>The influence Brawl Stars in the real world</h2>
<p>Even in the real world Brawl Stars takes a big influence. More and more dances from Brawl Stars can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, pubs and football matches. These dances are very popular among players and also find great recognition in the real world. On YouTube, there are some people dancing these dances or offering tutorials that show how to do the dance you want.</p>
<p>On playgrounds, different children and teens practice the various dances with each other, as they are very funny and amusing for them. But those who think that this is just something for children and adolescents are completely off the mark: the French player Antoine Griezmann is one of the few football players who likes to perform the Brawl Stars dances as a goal.</p>
<h2>Mode 2: Save the world</h2>
<p>A not so well-known mode of Brawl Stars is the &#8220;Save the World&#8221; mode, where you compete with a team against AI opponents who are zombies. There you have to build a base, kill zombies and survive as long as possible. At the latest by the end of 2018 this mode should be offered free of charge as well as the well-known Battle Royal mode.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-231" src="http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/THE-HISTORY-OF-BRAWL-STARS-FROM-A-TO-Z-300x85.png" alt="THE HISTORY OF BRAWL STARS FROM A TO Z" width="759" height="215" srcset="http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/THE-HISTORY-OF-BRAWL-STARS-FROM-A-TO-Z-300x85.png 300w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/THE-HISTORY-OF-BRAWL-STARS-FROM-A-TO-Z-768x218.png 768w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/THE-HISTORY-OF-BRAWL-STARS-FROM-A-TO-Z-1024x290.png 1024w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/THE-HISTORY-OF-BRAWL-STARS-FROM-A-TO-Z.png 1288w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></p>
<p>Any game would improve a lot and would be a very solid option if you were a player who is following certain strategies and plans to become a bit more conspicuous over time. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do about this <strong>Brawl Stars Guide</strong>.</p>
<p>Scroll down if you&#8217;re still interested in understanding the key keys and options to follow. Over the past few decades, they&#8217;ve been researching the smartphones and trying to understand the major differences in the battery charge, and we can tell you that this is the case. A bad signal will simply drain a lot of battery and you&#8217;ll see your device as a flop. You may be wondering what this part has to do with the main topic. We will answer all these questions in the next part.</p>
<h2>Fast information</h2>
<p>Every brawler comes with a list of advantages and disadvantages. He will be our main concern to help you get the Brawlers from now on, and evading the useless ones will now be so much easier.</p>
<p>Stop wasting time and start to illustrate the brawlers with a focus on the pros and cons and some plans for using them, if you are not a user of <strong>Brawl Stars cheats</strong> and have full access to all brawlers.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of spike</h3>
<p>Spike: This is a very risky brawler because it requires special care and teamwork. However, you&#8217;ll find that after just a few hours of playing and coping, you only realize how deadly this little beast is on the battlefield.</p>
<p>This brawler is solid when it comes to team battles, but he will struggle a lot in the individual bouts, but still a very solid option.</p>
<h2>What are you waiting for from a company that has developed such a &#8220;Clash Royale&#8221; game?</h2>
<p>We have not yet reached the pros and cons of the SPIKE racquet, so we would like to continue here before moving on to another one.</p>
<p>The low health and vulnerabilities that are more likely to occur when you are in an open environment are nothing and have nothing left to provide you with protection and support. These are the biggest weaknesses we&#8217;ve seen so far in this brawler, and we do not recommend them to anyone trying to establish themselves in the game.</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="http://proton4.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brawl Stars Hack </a></p>
<h2>Final judgment</h2>
<p>You must know that the <strong>Brawl Stars Hack</strong> will provide you with various options to adapt to. In addition, this is the main idea when creating the service. Read the remaining brawlers in more detail until you decide to choose the brawler that meets your needs.</p>
<p>There are some great brawlers for each mode in the game. They all depend on how you play with them and how you can roughly control the pace of the battlefield. Keeping up to date with the change log would be a big blow to your enemies.</p>
<p>If you are reading this preview, we have found that you are looking for answers and instructions that could make you superior in the game and easily eliminate every opponent in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Achieving such a goal will be difficult, even after the Brawl Stars cheats there will be some issues and obstacles that you will have to endure on your own. However, we will try to talk about the most common issues where every new player drops you, and there will be an alternative to the solution itself.</p>
<h2>Fast introduction</h2>
<p>First, you need to know how matchmaking works. Depending on this point, your selection of brawlers could be significantly improved from this perspective.</p>
<p>The latest updates in the game have prevented anyone from coming into play with a duplicate Brawler. So suppose you have selected the SPIKE brawler, this will be the only SPIKE on the battlefield.</p>
<p>For every playable mode in the game, there&#8217;s a brawler that shines in there, no matter what you throw at it. That will be the focus from now on.</p>
<h3>The right brawler for the right card</h3>
<p>Temple Ruins, and Outlaw Camp are two types of cards required by you to track a particular brawler who will manage to dominate them everywhere. This is no secret, but few players have access to this information.</p>
<p>Spike brawlers will find a comfortable zone here because the place is made up of small towns and there is no room where the enemies can catch you in an open fight. That&#8217;s a big advantage if you ask me, but that&#8217;s not our main topic here.</p>
<h3>What is the new trophy ranking system?</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve been asking the same question over and over again, and it&#8217;s mainly referring to the new trophy rating system they added to the gameplay system at the last update.</p>
<p>This is a very clever idea of ​​them, and we enjoyed this step as it creates new boundaries and the ability to reach new levels without having to worry about anything is just great.</p>
<p>Getting trophies to reach new ranks will help you buy new upgrades as these coins are always welcome and we can not remember anyone who would ignore them.</p>
<h2>Send us your suggestions!</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via the email below. This will help us deliver higher quality content and improve the gameplay level for everyone.</p>
<p>Before we get started, you need to get to know the three most important priorities when it comes to improving and spending the coins won by Brawl Stars cheats.</p>
<p>Super, Attack and Health are the three main features you should keep in mind in the upcoming parts of the gameplay itself. It will pay off later if you advance.</p>
<p>Before we deal directly with our main topic, we have to tell you about the total sales of the game so far. They managed to reach the $ 1 billion only from IOS users. In addition, this case does not include the Android users because the game is not yet available there.</p>
<p>However, do not be over the top as the company is known for completing great projects and canceling projects that are already running. Only time can tell us where the game will be from now on the leaderboard.</p>
<h4>Change log of the latest update</h4>
<p>Each game in the store has received several types of updates to help with troubleshooting and to improve the salt on almost any device to make sure that you are right on this point.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://twitter.com/BrawlStars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brawl Stars</a> guide we will be able to handle the latest update with all its content to make the game easier and to attract more players to this soothing and powerful gaming experience.</p>
<h3>New Brawls changes</h3>
<p>The first thing we have to mention are the modified nine brawlers. They have experienced a very strong push through the game and will become the best favorites in the coming time.</p>
<p>Remember that every brawler has its own weakness. This is a very difficult challenge that we currently do not plan to break the record.</p>
<p>The buffs are in the form of increasing certain skills over time. If you do your best to pull a brawler out of the trends, this is not a difficult step if you are going to get results very quickly.</p>
<h2>Walkthrough of the Brawlers details</h2>
<p>We believe that there is no website to do this detailed preview of the patch patch, and we were a big fan of the company. Therefore, there will be instant access to the update preview and be an experience in the right hands the first time in front of everyone else.</p>
<p>Bo: The Brawler was known for his big heart and his low skills on the battlefield, and from an ethical point of view, we actually meant that we wanted to be so active according to the coach&#8217;s plan on and off the bitch.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve used the Brawl Stars cheats, you may also have the chance to get all the brawlers we mention here.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you have not yet installed this update, you need to know that you have missed many features, but most of them are not very effective, they are more like Notch devices. Therefore, if you have a very decent experience and believe that your current software can run the game smoothly.</p>
<p>The Brawl Stars Hack offers you the opportunity to have tons of gold and leave the people of Agar behind.</p>

<h3>What game modes are there in Brawl Stars?</h3>
<p>In total, there are six game modes available to launch Brawl Stars, most of which are designed as three-on-three modes:</p>
<p><strong>Gem Grab</strong> (3 vs. 3): In this mode, teams must collect gems. It wins the team, which has ten of the Klunker together and can then hold them for a certain time. Of course, the glittering things can be stolen the counter party again.</p>
<p><strong>Showdown</strong> (1 vs. 1/2 vs. 2): Showdown is the only game mode in Brawl Stars that can be played both alone and as a two-player team. The match is best compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battle Royale</a> games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown%27s_Battlegrounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PUBG</a> , because in the end you just have to survive to win.</p>
<p><strong>Bounty</strong> (3 vs. 3): Here is the task rather simple, because you should do only the players of the opposing team. But you get stars as a reward, but you lose them when you are blown away. In the end, the team that has collected the most of these stars wins.</p>
<p><strong>Heist</strong> (3 vs. 3): In Heist, each team has a safe to protect from the other team. At the same time, however, it is important to crack the counter party&#8217;s vault.</p>
<p><strong>Brawl Ball</strong> (3 vs. 3): Brawl Ball is like football without a referee. The goal is to score two goals to win the match. To prevent this, the two teams are allowed to take all kinds of measures.</p>
<p><strong>Special Events:</strong> The special events in Brawl Stars you have to unlock with trophies. Then you can compete in PvE matches where you fight against computer-controlled adversaries.</p>

<h2>Beginners Tips to Brawl Stars</h2>
<p>Now that you know what Brawl Stars is and how you get it, we want to give you some tips and hints to help you quickly achieve success in the various game modes:</p>
<p>When you launch Brawl Stars, the first question is which characters are best suited for newcomers. Here we recommend the following five:</p>
<p><strong>Brock:</strong> So to speak, the standard character everyone should be able to cope with<br />
<strong>El Primo:</strong> Also very easy to handle because it puts a lot of damage away.<br />
<strong>Jessie:</strong> Fighter with ranged attacks that do a lot of damage.<br />
<strong>Colt:</strong> Also a ranged fighter whose attacks also wreak havoc and have a good range.<br />
<strong>Barley:</strong> A fighter whose attacks inflict damage over time, which can be really annoying for your opponents.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-215 aligncenter" src="http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brawl-stars-strategy-300x169.jpg" alt="brawl stars strategy" width="593" height="334" srcset="http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brawl-stars-strategy-300x169.jpg 300w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brawl-stars-strategy-768x432.jpg 768w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brawl-stars-strategy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brawl-stars-strategy-800x450.jpg 800w, http://proton4.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brawl-stars-strategy.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /></p>
<p>The different fighters that you stand for does not just look different but also have different abilities. Therefore , think about a match , which Brawler selects her, in the optimal case, the choice of your teammates adapts. El Primo, for example, can take damage properly and is therefore ideal to protect the other whipping boys in the team. Brock, on the other hand, should rather stay in the background, since his attacks can be considered as far-off attacks.</p>
<p>When choosing a fighter, it is not only important to know what role he should best play in the team. It also helps a lot if you know how fast your character&#8217;s attacks will find their target . Some attacks take some time to break, so you have to anticipate to hit your opponent.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your character&#8217;s life energy display . As long as you do not take any damage or even pass attacks, the life energy of your protegee slowly regenerates. Therefore, retreating is sometimes a good strategy. Of course, your opponent then has the opportunity to strengthen himself. So you have to weigh what makes more sense.</p>

<p>Use the practice mode in Brawl Stars . In this you are not against human opponents, but against computer-controlled. This helps to learn to play the chosen character and at the same time gets a feel for the game modes and the cards being played.</p>
<p>When you finally start in one of the team modes, always try to attack the adversary your teammates are attacking . This is the most effective way to turn off characters.</p>
<p>In general, it is advisable to stay together in the team modes and watch the other players. For example, if you see that your life&#8217;s energy is running low and you are playing a fighter with lots of energy, then it makes perfect sense to catch fire.</p>
